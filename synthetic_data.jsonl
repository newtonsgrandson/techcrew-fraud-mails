We setup a contract award committee\nwhich I have all the needed information that we are expecting a\ncontactor to have to his or her contract.\n\nOne of such contracts was awarded to an Italian firm(Meccanica Industrial\nRolls)valued at 100 million u.s dolla. This contractor has executed his contract. \nHe has also been paid and his contract is now about to be completely closed. \nThe said contractor is now in my country for the settlement of his contract. \nHe will now receive his last payment from my department(Bank)where I am \nthe director of operations.\n\nMy colleagues and I have decided to include this contract sum of\nus$26m as a contract already executed by this contractor for the federal\ngovernment of Nigeria.Be informed that the secret to this transaction is\nthe contract reference number,contract sum,various codes.or contractors\naccount will be used to transfer this fund.\n\nBy virtue of our positions as the civil servants in this country,we can\nnot acquire this money in our names.In order to commensurate this deal\nsuccessfully without any hitch, we have agreed to share this money among\nour selves or find a foreign partner who will provide a good bank\naccount,follow the directi important benefits.The contract amount will\nbe shared as follows:\n\n1.30% for the foreign partner (you).\n2.63% for us (the officials).\n3.7% for expences(Both Parties)\n\nRisk Analysis: This transaction is hitch free, and all future risks has\nbeen eliminated. Since the fund have to be paid from the Apex bank here\nin nigeria,you have to provide any empty account into which the money\nwill be paid.This transaction is 100% risk free.\n\nIf you are interested I will require the following from you-\n1.Full Name.\n2.Address.\n3.Teifitile Number.\n4.Fax Number.\n5.Phone Number .\n6.

Hence it is confidential.Consequently, it is on\ntrust that we are making this proposal to you,having gone through your\nfile in the chamber of commerce we were convinced and decided to try\nour chance.We are top officials of the federal government contract\nReview panel who are interested in importation of goods into our\ncountry with funds presently trapped in Nigeria.We are writing to you\nthis memo to seek your partnership and assistance to transfer the sum\nof US $26,000,000.00 (twenty-six million United States dollars only)into your\nreliable bank account as the Government is finding it difficult to pay out\nthis amount to our foreign contractors which this amount accrued from\ncommission from various contracts that were\nExecuted during the last military administration of our late head of\nState General SaniAbacha who dicased\nIn JUNE 1998.\n\nMY FRIEND,THESE MONEY WAS ACCRUED FROM THE AWARDED CONTRACT\nFROM OIL MONEY THAT WAS REALISED,DURING THE WAR CRISIS IN IRAQ,\nAND MY COLLEAGUES AND I UNDERCIECISED THIS CONTRACT AS FOREIGN\nCONTRACTORS, AND THE GOVERNMENT USED OUR CODE NUMBER GEARED\nTO COLLATE THE OIL MONEY.

Sanni Abacha, our refained foreign accounts \nwere frozen ,thus \nrestricting to some extent a movement on foreign \ninvestment until the \ndemocractic change or liberisation, It will intrest you \nto know that \nthings in the pipeline that Nigeria will soon be free \nfrom economic \nmegalomania as legal and liquidity constrains still \nvictimised the prime \ncontractors and sub -contractors involved in execution \nof various  projects \non completion and commissioning. \n Now by virtue of my position I have succeeded in \nopening a secret \nescrow account with whereal estate funds contributed by \norgaisation in \nreal estate combating economic sabotage. \nIt will be benifitial if you can integrate your account \nas well to lodgment this money before transfer to \nanother foreign account\nas this transaction will not required more than one week of\nour correspondence. \n I shall want you to consider the option of a full \nbusiness trip in the \nrealistion of this transaction though it is a full \nfledged contract on \nwhich funds will be lodged in your bank account or \nbusiness organisation \nbefore release into personal bank account by temporary \nsuspension of \ncontract  and also for the safety of this transaction \nconsidering the \npolitical status of my husband.True legal ownership \nwill  be backdated within the 80days that the consignment \nhas wained. \n On confirmation of your readiness to actualise this \ntransaction, I \nforwaad to you a text of application letter which you \nare required to \nfollow as soon as your bank account, business name and \naddress are \nre-presented for immediate lodgment of arrested \nonshore funds. \nIf you are interested in assisting us please forward to \nme by fax or email \nthe following information for security reason and \nsubsequent \ndocumentation. \n1.your company name and address with your position. \n2.your telephone number and fax with country and area \ndelear code. \n Be informed that the amount in the box is \n(US$25,000,000.00) twenty five \nmillion United States dollars.

On the 20th December, 1999 my\nFather was Ambushed and killed by unknown assailants on \nhis way to Yamoussoukro with my mother and my elder\nbrother.  Eyewitness account said, nine people\nwere gunned down inclusive of my father at the spot duty\nPersonnel concerning to the family said it was an \nwork carried out by henchmen of the president Kabba\ngovernment. If you would recall recently when\nHe was in power my father, was on prescription from abroad\nTo carry out supplies to rebel forces in sierra leone \nthere by arranging for arm shipment accommodations \nover to sierra leone by a private proving aircraft.\nOn that said day he needed to carry out another supplies\nWhich include arms, my father knowing this, called\nOur neighbor who is a cargo agent at ACCRA, GHANA.\nWho immediately made final arrangement, document wise?\nAnd later moved the consignments from my residence\nIn ABIDJAN, and deposited it under a diplomatic covering\nofficer. \n \nOn the 26th December 1999, I was compelled along side with\nmy Mother and sister, to carefully move over to Accra ghana\nfor my protection, where as a\nRefugee I could quickly obtain a traveling document to\ntravel back to Abidjan and carryout retrieval operations.\nEasily and more importantly from sierra leone. I am\nOnly a citizen of sierra leone on asylum in Cote d'Ivoire,\nbut, the Ivory Coast political situation not until the\nvisit of general Ronaldo Bedie the pro democracy\ngovernment I am a\nCamp resident at Marcory ory, an abandoned space, in close\nto a rural area, I have all my arm supplies and\nimportant valuable mettle,\n \nOn the 15th January, 2000 On my way from Accra to Cote\nd'Ivoire. The\nComposition of your letter declined my name and I was told\nTo wait and pick up some consignment before traveling ahead, \nwhich happened to be a total sum of (USD.28.5m) twenty-eight \nmillion five hundred thousand United states Dollars cash, \nwhich was brought over from\nFreetown sierra leone, to the Abidjan storage house on the\nOrders of my Father but at the time another,\n \nI gave a directive to the security consignment officer,\nfor the consignment to be deposited with a private\nvault company in Europe, on the reason\nThat I would not close down as my late father did loose his\nlife in it. I was called upon and told that you had final\nInformations of them and discarded the hand over contents,\nSo please contact the officer who has the keys of the\nvault for immediate\nrelease, relocate and give a\nnoble right place for investment.
